If you haven't already, [install Visual Studio Code from Microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com). If you need more help, you can view [this page](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics) to help you get set up.

Now, you can install teaspoon by first downloading the VSIX package from [the releases page](https://git.keithley.com/trebuchet/teaspoon/teaspoon/-/releases/permalink/latest).

After downloading, you can run the following in your terminal:

Or you can open VSCode, open the command pallette (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) and type "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
